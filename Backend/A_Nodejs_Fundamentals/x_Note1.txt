NODEJS
What is Node.js?
Nodejs is a JavaScript 
runtime built on Chrome's 
V8 JavaScript Engine

What are the uses of Nodejs?
Nodejs is primarily used for 
non-blocking, event-driven
servers, due to its single
threaded nature.

The Node REPL

REPL - Read Eval Print Loop

What is REPL?
Read-Eval-Print-Loop is a 
computer environment where 
user inputs are read and 
evaluated, and then the 
results are returned to the 
user.

The File System (fs)

When we write our codes in
Nodejs to build an 
application we normally
place them in different
files.

Modules
What is a module?
A module is a file that is
exporting some codes.

Require
We use require to get the 
exact module we want.

Reading & Writing to files
To read and write to files 
in nodejs, we use one of 
nodejs core modules known
as fs

To read files, we use a 
method called readFileSync()
Eg: fs.readFileSync()
This method takes in two
arguments:
1. The first argument is the
full path of the file we 
want to read.
2. The second argument is 
character encoding because
we are dealing with binary
data eg: 'utf-8'


readFileSync is a 
synchronous operation.

To write files, we use:
writeFileSync() method

This takes two parameters:
1. the name of the file we
want to write to.
2. the data we want to write
into the file


Module.export 
Module.export is a Global
object
NB:
1. In node, Global is a 
global object.
2. In DOM, window is the 
global object

Class work
1. use the fs module to
2. read and write files
3. create two other files
4. in one, create a function
that performs an operation
of adding two numbers together
5. Now export this function
6. invoke this function in 
the second file, as well as
passing in the necessary 
arguments(two numbers)

Tip:
1. function expression.
eg: 
var add2Num = function(){

}
2. function definition
eg: 
function add2Num(){
	
}
