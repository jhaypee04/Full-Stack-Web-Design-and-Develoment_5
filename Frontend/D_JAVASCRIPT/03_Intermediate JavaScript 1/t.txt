Write an if statement to decide whether you will go to the market on a monday, saturday or on a sunday.
1. The condition for the first if() will check if monday is a market day.
2. The condition for the second if() will check the purpose of sunday and compare it to whether it aligns with the condition of the first if() statement.
3. The last condition should evaluate if all other if() statements are false.
