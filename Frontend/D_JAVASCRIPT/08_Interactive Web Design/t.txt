Classwork
1. Create any number of elements in your index.html file.
2. Assign to these elements a general class name 
3. Use JavaScript to grab these elements from the DOM
4. Then inject/insert some text contents into each and every one of the elements
TIP: use either the CSS query selector approach or the old school method
